Since it began to escape from AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the early
1970's,
the success of the UNIX operating system
has led to many
different versions: recipients of the (at that time free) UNIX system


code all began developing their own different versions in their own,
different, ways for use and sale. Universities, research institutes,
government bodies and computer
companies all began using the powerful
UNIX system to develop many of the technologies which today are part
of a UNIX system.

Computer
aided design, manufacturing control systems, laboratory
simulations, even the Internet itself, all began life with and because
of UNIX systems. Today,
.po
without UNIX systems, the Internet would come
to a screeching halt. Most
telephone calls could not be made,
electronic commerce would grind to a halt and there would have never
been "Jurassic Park"!
By
the
late 1970's, a ripple effect had come into play. By now the
under- and post-graduate students whose lab work had pioneered these
new applications of technology
were attaining management and
decision-making positions
inside the computer system suppliers and
among its customers. And they wanted to continue using UNIX systems.

Soon all the large vendors, and many smaller ones, were marketing
.pn
their own, diverging, versions of the UNIX system optimized for their
own computer architectures and boasting many different strengths and
features. Customers found that, although UNIX systems were available

everywhere, they seldom were
able to interwork or co-exist without
significant investment of time and effort to make them work
